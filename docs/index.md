# tinygp

**The tiniest of Gaussian Process libraries.**

`tinygp` is an extremely lightweight library for Gaussian Process (GP)
regression in Python, built on top of [`jax`](https://github.com/google/jax). It
is not (yet?) designed to provide all the shiniest algorithms for scalable
computations (check out [celerite2](https://celerite2.readthedocs.io) or
[GPyTorch](https://gpytorch.ai) if you need something like that), but I think it
has a [nice interface](api) and it's pretty fast. Thanks to `jax`, `tinygp`
supports things like GPU acceleration and automatic differentiation.

```{admonition} How to find your way around?
:class: tip

ðŸ‘‰ A good place to get started is with the [installation guide](install) and then
the [tutorials](tutorials).

ðŸ‘‰ For all the details, check out the [full API documentation](api), including a
list of all the [built-in kernel functions](api#kernels).

ðŸ‘‰ If you find bugs or otherwise have trouble getting `tinygp` to do what you want,
head on over to the [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/dfm/tinygp/issues).
