    "# Custom kernels: Radial velocity example\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate the flexibility of the `tinygp` kernel building interface, we will build a custom kernel that is commonly used when studying radial velocity observations of exoplanet-hosting stars, as described by [Rajpaul et al. (2015)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.07304).\n",
    "Take a look at that paper for more details about the math, but the tl;dr is that we want to model a set parallel, but qualitatively different, time series, using a latent Gaussian process.\n",
    "The interesting part of this model is that Rajpaul et al. model the observations as arbitrary linear combinations of the process and its first time derivative, and they work through the derivation of the resulting kernel function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will implement this kernel using `tinygp`—something that is significantly more annoying to do with other Gaussian process frameworks (trust me, I've tried!)—and demonstrate a few key features along the way.\n",
    "Besides describing the interface for implementing new kernels and kernel transforms, we also show how `tinygp` can support arbitrary [JAX pytrees](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pytrees.html) as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "The kernel matrix described by [Rajpaul et al. (2015)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.07304) is a block matrix where each element is a linear combination of the latent kernel and its first and second derivatives, where the relevant coefficients depend on the \"class\" of each pair of observations.\n",
    "This means that our input data needs to include, at each observation, the time `t` (our input coordinate in this case) and an integer class label `label`.\n",
    "As discussed below, we will structure our data in such a way that we can treat each input as being a tuple `(t, label)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's implement this kernel in a way that `tinygp` understands.\n",
    "When doing this, you will subclass {class}`tinygp.kernels.Kernel` and implement the {func}`tinygp.kernels.Kernel.evaluate` method.\n",
    "One very important thing to note here is that `evaluate` will always be called via `vmap`, so you should write your `evaluate` method to operate on a **single pair of inputs** and let `vmap` handle the broadcasting sematics for you.\n",
    "In this case, we will unpack our inputs `t, label = X` and treat `t` and `label` as scalars.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's our implementation:"
